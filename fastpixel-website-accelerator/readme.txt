### 🆕 New! Object Cache – Now Available! ### 
You can now connect FastPixel to your Redis or Memcached server and let our plugin handle the rest. 
Object caching stores the results of database queries in memory, so WordPress skips repetitive work on every page load, meaning faster pages and less load on your server. No configuration needed. Just connect and go.
- No need for additional plugins
- Tuned for WooCommerce compatibility
- Built for maximum performance with the same resources
- Smart cache prefetching
- Fully compliant with WordPress
- Improved efficiency with simple settings and defaults
- Encrypted communication

== 💡 Why choose FastPixel Caching plugin? ==
- **Website Performance Boost**: Just activate the plugin and within seconds the optimized webpages will start to be served.
- **Lower the CPU/RAM Impact**: Using the plugin will reduce the impact on the resources used by your website. All the CPU intensive processing is done in the cloud and resulting pages will generally be served from a cached version and the optimized images from the CDN.
- **Automated Core Web Vitals Optimization**: FastPixel takes care of all technical aspects automatically.
- **Smart Cache Warmup/Update**: The cache warmup and update are taken care of automatically in a smart way. Pages are cached as they are visited and also updated if you update the content.
- **Critical CSS**: CCSS is automatically generated for each page for lightning-fast page loads.
- **CSS/JS Processing**: CSS/JS files are combined and also minified and compressed before they are served from our CDN.
- **HTML Optimization**: A single, highly optimized HTML file is generated, adaptively serving the ideal webpage based on the visitor's viewport or device (e.g., mobile, tablet, laptop).
- **DNS Preconnects**: Accelerates resource fetching, reduces the access time to external resources.
- **Font Processing**: All the techniques to accelerate the processing and delivery of fonts are employed, e.g. font subsetting, font loading control, font compression, font embedding (lower CLS result).
- **Image Resizing & Optimization**: Images are automatically resized to fit their placeholders, optimized, and delivered through the ShortPixel CDN.
- **Automatic Next-Gen Images Delivery**: Based on the visitor's browser capabilities, original JPG, PNG, or GIF images are converted to and served as WebP or AVIF when supported. For browsers without support, the original format is provided.

If you encounter any issues or suspect interference with other plugins or widgets, please don't hesitate to [contact us](https://fastpixel.io/#contact).

= Do I need a cache plugin for WordPress? =
Yes, a caching plugin is essential for speeding up your website and improving its performance!

= What is the importance of using caching plugins in WordPress? =
Caching plugins in WordPress improve website performance by storing static versions of your pages, reducing server load, and speeding up load times. This enhances user experience, boosts SEO rankings, and can handle higher traffic more efficiently.

= Is FastPixel compatible with other cache plugins? =
If you're using this plugin alongside other caching tools like WP Rocket, LiteSpeed Cache, WP Optimize or W3 Total Cache, make sure to disable them to make this one work at the best performance.

= Is there an external service used by FastPixel plugin? =
Our plugin integrates with an external service via dedicated API endpoints. This process involves sending a request with specific data to the server API endpoint, which then queues and processes the request to generate HTML content. Once your request reaches the front of the queue, the service processes the data, generates the HTML content based on the specified URL, and then sends the HTML back to the plugin using the provided postback URL. The plugin automatically receives the generated HTML content and saves it to the disk on your WordPress installation. This process is designed to be seamless and requires no manual intervention.

Example data sent to server API endpoint 'https://api.fastpixel.io/api/v1/enqueue' to request HTML page generation: 

`{
    "url":"https://example.com/",
    "postbackUrl":"https://example.com/wp-json/fastpixel-website-accelerator/v1/update",
    "settings":{
        "modules":{
            "ScriptRewrite":{
                "enabled":true,
                "settings":{
                    "exclude":{
                        "strings":[],
                        "regexps":[]
                    },
                    "eventHandlersRewrite":false,
                    "excludeGDPR":true
                },
            "injectBootstrapScripts":true,
            "rdelay":0
            },
            "ImageRewrite":{
                "enabled":true,
                "settings":{
                    "forceImageDimensions":false
                }
            },
            "ReducedFonts":{
                "settings":{
                    "soft":true
                }
            }
        },
        "imageQuality":"lossy",
        "cropImages":false
    },
    "plugin_version":"1.0.22",
    "siteKey":"randomKey"
}`

Also there are two enpoints on external service: 
https://api.fastpixel.io/api/v1/purge_all - this endpoint is used to request pages cache. Url is put into queue and once your request reaches the front of the queue, service processes request. Service request page and parse it to get list of links to other pages. Pages from this list are requested too. New html pages will be prepared and send back to wordpress installation for all pages from the list.
Example data sent to server API endpoint 'https://api.fastpixel.io/api/v1/purge_all' to request HTML page generation: 

`{
    "url":"https://example.com/",
    "siteKey":"randomKey"
}`

https://api.fastpixel.io/api/v1/detect_endpoints - this endpoint is used to check which rest api route is available, /wp-json/fastpixel-website-accelerator/v1/update or ?rest_route=/fastpixel-website-accelerator/v1/update. Response from this endpoint return list of available endpoints and first item from this list is saved for future use. This endpoint is used only if default rest api endpoint is not available.
Example data sent to server API endpoint 'https://api.fastpixel.io/api/v1/detect_endpoints' to request HTML page generation: 

`{
    "url":"https://example.com/",
    "siteKey":"randomKey"
}`
